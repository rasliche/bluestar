    h3 What is Blue Star
    p The Blue Star program was established to recognize tour operators who work to reduce the impact of divers and snorkelers on coral reefs of the Florida Keys. Unlike some of the major causes of reef decline such as climate change, damage to reefs from diving and snorkeling is considered preventable.
    p As a Blue Star partner, your business has voluntarily agreed to educate customers about the coral reef ecosystem, the Sanctuary, and diving and snorkeling etiquette. By passing this information on to visitors who dive or snorkel in the Keys, you are playing an important role in helping to protect our reefs.
